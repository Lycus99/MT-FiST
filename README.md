# MT-FiST Source Code
Created by Yuchong Li

This repository contains PyTorch implementation for MT-FiST.

We introduce a multi-task fine-grained spatio-temporal model (MT-FiST) to recognize surgical action triplets in CholecT50 Dataset. 

Our code is based on [MT-RCNet-CL](https://github.com/YuemingJin/MTRCNet-CL) and [MC Loss](https://github.com/PRIS-CV/Mutual-Channel-Loss).

The dataset and evaluation metrics are [here](https://github.com/CAMMA-public/cholect50). 

## Pretrained models

We use the ResNet-50 as the backbone pre-trained on ImageNet-1K. 

## Model weights and .pkl file

Our model weights and the .pkl file can be downloaded in [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wjo1AgDiSPjeysMDdhq5glpQ8qENFLDT?usp=drive_link).
